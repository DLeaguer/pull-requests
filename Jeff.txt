pull-request forked 
writing something interesting
noticed some did, some didn't

writing this on sublime text 3

had to use git bash command line shell
the commands don't work in windows cmd.exe
windows doesn't recognize the command 'git'
'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

instructions for git bash command line shell
after forking from git hub
copy to clipboard by left clicking on the green button named clone or download
then click on the clipboard icon to the right of the URL
in the git bash shell make sure you have cd (change directory) to the correct folder you want to clone the forked file
then in the git bash shell type 'git clone '
then to paste (the copy in the clipboard) into the git bash shell press 'Shift + Ins' (press shift key with insert key together)
then press enter and that should clone the fork to your computer
